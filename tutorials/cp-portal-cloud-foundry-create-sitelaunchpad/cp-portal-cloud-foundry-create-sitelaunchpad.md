# Create a Site Using SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition
<!-- description --> Create a site to which you can later add business apps.

## Prerequisites
You have subscribed to SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition and assigned yourself to the `Launchpad_Admin` role

## You will learn
  - How to create a site using SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition

## Intro
In this tutorial we'll create a site for a recruiting company called `JobCore`. We'll then add business apps to this site.

### Create a site


When you access the SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition, the Site Directory is in focus. From here you'll create your new site.

> In the side panel, you'll see four tools. The **Site Directory** where you're going to create a new site. All sites that you create will be displayed here. The **Content Manager** where you'll manage cross-site content such as business apps. The **Channel Manager** where you manage different channels that expose business content that you can integrate into your sites. The fourth icon opens **Settings** where you can configure various settings related to your subaccount.


1. Click **Create Site**.

You've just created a site called `JobCore`.



### Navigate to the Site Directory


When you create a site, you are directed to the **Site Settings** screen where you can edit the site settings and assign a site to a specific user role.

Navigate back to the **Site Directory** to view the site tile.
